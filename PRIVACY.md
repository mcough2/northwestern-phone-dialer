# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: March 10, 2025_

Northwestern Phone Dialer ("the App") is designed as a simple utility to assist staff in dialing Northwestern Memorial Hospital extensions. This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use it.

## Information We Collect
The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. All phone numbers you enter remain on your device and are used solely to construct a dialable number.

## Phone and Contact Access
The App opens the native Phone application using the `tel://` URL scheme to initiate calls. It does not access your contacts, call history, or any other personal data.

## Analytics and Tracking
The App does not include analytics services, advertising frameworks, or third-party SDKs that track user activity.

## Children’s Privacy
Because the App does not collect personal information, it is compliant with applicable regulations regarding children’s privacy.

## Changes to This Policy
If the functionality of the App changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## Contact Us
For questions about this policy or the App, contact the project maintainer through your internal IT support channels.
